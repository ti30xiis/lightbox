My program consists of the following files:

app.js

app.css

index.html

DomUtilityService.js


I am using document fragments to increase DOM performance. 

I am also caching elements to decrease DOM lookups. 

I made a DOM utility class for creating any DOM elements/document fragments.


I added alt descriptions to img for accessibility and for SEO.

Hovering over images and buttons that lead to actions will enlargen to notify the user that it is clickable.



If I had been using a build tool, I would have broken individual script files into modules. Since I am not using a build tool, individual script files are included into global.
